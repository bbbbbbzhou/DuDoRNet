    Subsample given k-space by multiplying with a mask.

            dimensions -3 and -2 are the spatial dimensions, and the final dimension has size
            2 (for complex values).
        mask_func (callable): A function that takes a shape (tuple of ints) and a random
            number seed and returns a mask.
        seed (int or 1-d array_like, optional): Seed for the random number generator.
    Returns:
        (tuple): tuple containing:
            masked data (torch.Tensor): Subsampled k-space data
            mask (torch.Tensor): The generated mask

    """
    MaskFunc creates a sub-sampling mask of a given shape.
    The mask selects a subset of columns from the input k-space data. If the k-space data has N
    columns, the mask picks out:
        a) N_low_freqs = (N * center_fraction) columns in the center corresponding to
           low-frequencies
        b) The other columns are selected uniformly at random with a probability equal to:
           prob = (N / acceleration - N_low_freqs) / (N - N_low_freqs).
    This ensures that the expected number of columns selected is equal to (N / acceleration)
    It is possible to use multiple center_fractions and accelerations, in which case one possible
    (center_fraction, acceleration) is chosen uniformly at random each time the MaskFunc object is
    called.
    For example, if accelerations = [4, 8] and center_fractions = [0.08, 0.04], then there
    is a 50% probability that 4-fold acceleration with 8% center fraction is selected and a 50%
    probability that 8-fold acceleration with 4% center fraction is selected.

                each time.
            accelerations (List[int]): Amount of under-sampling. This should have the same length
                as center_fractions. If multiple values are provided, then one of these is chosen
                uniformly each time. An acceleration of 4 retains 25% of the columns, but they may
